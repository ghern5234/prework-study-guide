        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is being presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines the color, aesthetic, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline, internal style sheet, and external style sheet.</li>
          <li>We can link an external style sheet using an link element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attribute to which the rules/declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Every CSS element is essentially a box, and each box consists of margins, padding, and borders.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>We combine two or more elements into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both the selectors.</li>
          <li>DRY stands for Do Not Repeat Yourself and is a principle that encourages developers to reuse/share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written/maintained.</li>
          <li>text-align is a rule assignment for positioning </li>
          <li>display-block assigns each element to start on a new line.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>To access Git we use the command line.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use GitHub</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with 'git' and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>ssh -T git@github.com checks the connection of the SSH key to your GitHub</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a high performance/dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>A string is a sequence of text enclosed in quotation marks.</li>
          <li>A Boolean is a True/False value.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An array allows you to store multiple vaules in a single reference.</li>
          <li>We use an index to locate/access individual data inside the array.</li>
          <li>= is an assignment value.</li>
          <li>=== is strict equality, which performs a test to see if the two values are equal and of the same data type.</li>
          <li>A function is a way of packing functional code that you wish to reuse.</li>
          <li>To declare a variable in Javascript, we can use const, var, or let.</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test an expression. They return true or not.</li>
          <li>We use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>The word console refers to the test environment that developers use to test and debug code.</li>
          <li>.log() is a method that will output whatever is inside the parentheses.</li>
          <li>A method is a set of instructions that tell the computer how to execute.</li>
          <li>To link Javascript to HTML file, we use a script element in the footer.</li>
          <li>To see the console.log in action we use the Chrome DevTools.</li>
          <li>We use 'command+option+I to open the developer tools.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision making into code.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to performa a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>We can find an arrays length by using a build in property named .length</li>
          <li>Let allows us to reassign the value of the variable over time.</li>
        </ul>
