        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is being presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines the color, aesthetic, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline, internal style sheet, and external style sheet.</li>
          <li>We can link an external style sheet usiing an link element.</li>
          <li>A selecetor defines the element or attribute to which the rules/declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Every CSS element is essentially a box, and each box consists of margins, padding, and borders.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>We combine two or more elements into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both the selectors.</li>
          <li>DRY stands for Do Not Repeat Yourself and is a principle that encourages developers to reuse/share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written/maintained.</li>
          <li>text-align is a rule assignment for positioning </li>
          <li>display-block assigns each element to start on a new line.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>To access Git we use the command line.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use GitHub</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with 'git' and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new breanch and switches to it</li>
          <li>ssh -T git@github.com checks the connection of the SSH key to your GitHub</li>
