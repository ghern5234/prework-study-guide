# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation behind this project was to create a singular archive for important/practical information acquired in the prework to be easily accessed when necessary. 
- This project was created not only as a repository for vital information, but also to serve as a contained environment for practicing writing/debugging code as well as seeing code live in action on a web console.
- It solves the issue of having course notes that may have limited accessibility, such as physical notes. It also condenses the extensive amount of information strewn about the modules on to one singular, easy to read page.
- The creation of this project has taught me the basics and integration of HMTL, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Additionally, the concepts of Git hub and Git flow.
